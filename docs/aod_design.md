# ‚öîÔ∏è Arena of Death Design Overview

This document outlines a complete design system for a turn-based fantasy tactics game, with a tight combat model optimized for web-based, grid-oriented arena play.

## üîÅ Turn Queue System

### Quickness-Based Turn Order

* Each unit has a **Quickness** stat from 1‚Äì20.
* After acting, a unit is re-added to the queue at:

  > `CurrentTick + (10 - Quickness) + 1d10`  (min 1 tick)

| Quickness | Delay Range (ticks) | Description      |
| --------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| 3         | 8‚Äì17                | Very slow        |
| 8         | 3‚Äì12                | Average          |
| 15        | -4‚Äì5 (min 1)        | Very fast        |
| 20        | -9‚Äì0 (min 1)        | Fastest possible |

Higher **Quickness** = more frequent turns.

---

## üéÆ Unit Turn Options

* On their turn, a unit may either:

  * **Move** (up to `Speed` tiles)
  * **Attack** with a ready weapon or cast a spell

Movement and attacks are exclusive actions.

---

## üèÉ Movement

* **Speed is dynamic** based on current health percentage
* **Speed Formula**: `2 + (currentHealth / maxHealth) * 5` (rounded up)
* **Speed Range**: 7 tiles (full health) down to 3 tiles (near death)
* Speed = number of tiles moved when choosing the **Move** action
* Quickness does not increase distance, only turn frequency

### Movement Examples
| Health % | Speed Calculation | Final Speed |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| 100%     | 2 + (1.0 * 5) = 7 | 7 tiles    |
| 80%      | 2 + (0.8 * 5) = 6 | 6 tiles    |
| 60%      | 2 + (0.6 * 5) = 5 | 5 tiles    |
| 40%      | 2 + (0.4 * 5) = 4 | 4 tiles    |
| 20%      | 2 + (0.2 * 5) = 3 | 3 tiles    |
| 1%       | 2 + (0.01 * 5) = 2.05 | 3 tiles (rounded up) |

* Movement from the center of one tile to the center of another costs:
  * **1 point** for horizontal or vertical
  * **1.4 points** for diagonal
* Pathfinding and movement cost is calculated accordingly

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Combat Resolution

### Stats:

All stats use a **1-20 scale** with **direct percentage mapping** (no lookup tables needed).

* **Health**: HP (0 = death), range 20-100 depending on class
* **Armor**: Flat damage reduction (min damage = 1), range 1-20 base + 1-5 from items
* **Strength (STR)**: Melee hit bonus and damage bonus (STR 15 = +15% hit, +15 damage)
* **Agility (AGI)**: Ranged hit bonus and defense vs melee/ranged (AGI 12 = +12% ranged hit, -12% to be hit)
* **Intelligence (INT)**: Magic hit bonus and defense vs spells (INT 18 = +18% magic hit, -18% to be hit by spells)
* **Quickness**: Turn frequency (1-20, affects turn delay: 10-Quickness+1d10)

### Hit Roll:

```
HitChance = Base + Weapon Bonus + Attacker Stat - Defender Stat
Clamp between 1% and 100%

Examples:
Melee: 10% + 80% (longsword) + 15% (STR) - 12% (enemy AGI) = 93%
Ranged: 10% + 70% (bow) + 18% (AGI) - 10% (enemy AGI) = 88%
Magic: 10% + 60% (staff) + 16% (INT) - 14% (enemy INT) = 72%
```

### Damage:

```
Damage = Roll(weapon dice) + Stat Bonus - Armor (min 1)

Examples:
Longsword: 1d8+8 + 15 (STR) - 8 (armor) = 16-23 damage (avg 19.5)
War Bow: 1d6+6 + 0 (no AGI bonus) - 5 (armor) = 2-7 damage (avg 4.5)
Fireball: 1d10+10 + 0 (no INT bonus) - 0 (no armor vs magic) = 11-20 damage (avg 15.5)

**One-Shot Potential**: Strong attacks (15-20 damage + stat bonus) can one-shot weak characters (20 HP)
```

## üß§ Equipment Rules

* Units can equip **2 items total**:

  * One **two-handed** item, OR
  * Two **one-handed** items
* **Each item** may contribute:

  * Melee stats (to-hit, damage)
  * Ranged stats (to-hit, damage, ammo, range)
  * Magic stats (to-hit, magic defense)
  * Armor (if shield or magical)
  * Cooldown: after use, item is unavailable for `X` turns and all its bonuses are inactive

### Item Rules:

* A **two-handed** weapon tends to have **1‚Äì2 turn cooldown**
* A **one-handed** heavy weapon: **2 turns**
* **Shields** always have **1 turn cooldown** (if bashed)
* **Magic items** may have 2‚Äì4 turn cooldowns
* Each item has a **primary role** (melee, ranged, magic), and may have one minor secondary role

---

## üëä Fallback Action

* If a unit has no usable item or spell:

  * They may use **Fist** (always available):

    * 1d2 damage, 0% hit bonus, no cooldown, no bonuses

---

## üéØ Attacks of Opportunity

* If a unit **leaves melee range**, the adjacent enemy may make **one free melee attack**:

  * Chosen from the strongest available (non-cooldown) melee item
  * If no such item is available, no attack occurs

---

## üß± Cover & Line of Sight

### Cover Types

* **None** ‚Äì no bonus
* **Half Cover** ‚Äì -25% hit to ranged
* **Full Cover** ‚Äì -50% hit and can block LoS

### Cover Rule:

* To determine if cover applies:

  * If aligned: check tile adjacent to target, in shooter's direction
  * If diagonal: check both X and Y adjacent tiles to target, use the better one

### Line of Sight (LoS):

* LoS is blocked if a **full cover tile** is between attacker and target *and* is not adjacent to either
* LoS check:

  * Draw line from source to target
  * Exclude tiles adjacent to either party if used as cover
  * If any remaining tile has full cover ‚Üí LoS is blocked

---

## üîÆ Spellcasting

* Spells are **cast from abilities**, not from items directly
* Magic items modify spell performance
* **No mana** system: balance through **cooldowns** (generally longer than weapons)
* Spells may:

  * Require to-hit roll (vs INT)
  * Be automatic (buffs, area effects)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Armor

* Units wear **one armor set** (or none)
* May provide:

  * Armor value (damage soak)
  * Minor melee or magic defense bonuses

### Sample Armor:

| Name        | Armor | Melee | Magic |
| ----------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Cloth Robes | 1     | 0     | +10%  |
| Leather     | 2     | +5%   | 0     |
| Chainmail   | 3     | +5%   | 0     |
| Plate       | 4     | 0     | -5%   |
